//! Efficient and seamless cross-process communication, providing semantics similar to
//! [`std::thread::spawn`] and alike, both synchronously and asynchronously (via tokio).
//!
//! This crate allows you to easily perform computations in another process without creating a
//! separate executable or parsing command line arguments manually. For example, the simplest
//! example, computing a sum of several numbers in a one-shot subprocess, looks like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[crossmist::main]
//! fn main() {
//!     println!("5 + 7 = {}", add.run(vec![5, 7]).unwrap());
//! }
//!
//! #[crossmist::func]
//! fn add(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
//!     nums.into_iter().sum()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This crate also supports long-lived tasks with constant cross-process communication:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[crossmist::main]
//! fn main() {
//!     let (mut ours, theirs) = crossmist::duplex().unwrap();
//!     add.spawn(theirs).expect("Failed to spawn child");
//!     for i in 1..=5 {
//!         for j in 1..=5 {
//!             println!("{i} + {j} = {}", ours.request(&vec![5, 7]).unwrap());
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[crossmist::func]
//! fn add(mut chan: crossmist::Duplex<i32, Vec<i32>>) {
//!     while let Some(nums) = chan.recv().unwrap() {
//!         chan.send(&nums.into_iter().sum());
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! ## Passing objects
//!
//! Almost arbitrary objects can be passed between processes and across channels, including file
//! handles, sockets, and other channels.
//!
//! For numeric types, strings, vectors, hashmaps, other common containers, and files/sockets, the
//! [`Object`] trait is implemented automatically. For user-defined structures and enums, use
//! `#[derive(Object)]`. You may use generics, but make sure to add `: Object` constraint to stored
//! types:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use crossmist::Object;
//!
//! #[derive(Object)]
//! struct MyPair<T: Object, U: Object> {
//!     first: T,
//!     second: U,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Occasionally, e.g. for custom hash tables or externally defined types, you might have to
//! implement [`Object`] manually. Check out the documentation for [`Object`] for more information.
//!
//!
//! ## Channels
//!
//! As the second example demonstrates, cross-process communication may be achieved not only via
//! arguments and return values, but via long-lived channels. Channels may be unidirectional (one
//! process has a [`Sender`] instance and another process has a connected [`Receiver`] instance) or
//! bidirectional (both processes have [`Duplex`] instances). Channels are typed: you don't just
//! send byte streams Ã  la TCP, you send objects of a well-defined type implementing the [`Object`]
//! trait, making channels type-safe.
//!
//! Channels implement [`Object`]. This means that not only can you pass channels to subprocesses
//! as arguments (they wouldn't be useful otherwise), but you can pass channels across other
//! channels, just like you can pass files across channels.
//!
//! Channels are trusted. This means that if one side reads from [`Receiver`] and another side
//! writes garbage to the corresponding file descriptor instead of using [`Sender`], the receiver
//! side may crash and burn, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
//!
//! The communication protocol is not fixed and may not only change in minor versions, but be
//! architecture- or build-dependent. This is done to both ensure performance optimizations can be
//! implemented and to let us fix bugs quickly when they arise. As channels may only be used between
//! two processes started from the same executable file, this does not violate semver.

extern crate self as crossmist;

/// Enable a function to be used as an entrypoint of a child process, and turn it into an
/// [`Object`].
///
/// This macro applies to `fn` functions, including generic ones. It turns the function into an
/// object that can be called (providing the same behavior as if `#[func]` was not used), but also
/// adds various methods for spawning a child process from this function.
///
/// For a function declared as
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[func]
/// fn example(arg1: Type1, ...) -> Output;
/// ```
///
/// ...the methods are:
///
/// ```ignore
/// pub fn spawn(&self, arg1: Type1, ...) -> std::io::Result<crossmist::Child<Output>>;
/// pub fn run(&self, arg1: Type1, ...) -> std::io::Result<Output>;
/// ```
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```rust
/// use crossmist::{func, main};
///
/// #[func]
/// fn example(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
///     a + b
/// }
///
/// #[main]
/// fn main() {
///     assert_eq!(example(5, 7), 12);
///     assert_eq!(example.spawn(5, 7).unwrap().join().unwrap(), 12);
///     assert_eq!(example.run(5, 7).unwrap(), 12);
/// }
/// ```
///
///
/// ## Asynchronous case
///
/// This section applies if the `tokio` feature is enabled.
///
/// The following methods are also made available:
///
/// ```ignore
/// pub async fn spawn_tokio(&self, arg1: Type1, ...) ->
///     std::io::Result<crossmist::tokio::Child<Output>>;
/// pub async fn run_tokio(&self, arg1: Type1, ...) -> std::io::Result<Output>;
/// ```
///
/// Additionally, the function may be `async`. In this case, you have to add the `#[tokio::main]`
/// attribute *after* `#[func]`. For instance:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[crossmist::func]
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn example() {}
/// ```
///
/// You may pass operands to `tokio::main` just like usual:
///
/// ```rust
/// #[crossmist::func]
/// #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
/// async fn example() {}
/// ```
///
/// Notice that the use of `spawn` vs `spawn_tokio` is orthogonal to whether the function is
/// `async`: you can start a synchronous function in a child process asynchronously, or vice versa:
///
/// ```rust
/// use crossmist::{func, main};
///
/// #[func]
/// fn example(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
///     a + b
/// }
///
/// #[main]
/// #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
/// async fn main() {
///     assert_eq!(example(5, 7), 12);
///     assert_eq!(example.run_tokio(5, 7).await.unwrap(), 12);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ```rust
/// use crossmist::{func, main};
///
/// #[func]
/// #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
/// async fn example(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
///     a + b
/// }
///
/// #[main]
/// fn main() {
///     assert_eq!(example.run(5, 7).unwrap(), 12);
/// }
/// ```
pub use crossmist_derive::func;

/// Setup an entrypoint.
///
/// This attribute must always be added to `fn main`:
///
/// ```rust
/// #[crossmist::main]
/// fn main() {
///     // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Without it, starting child processes will panic.
///
/// This attribute may be mixed with other attributes, e.g. `#[tokio::main]`. In this case, this
/// attribute should be the first in the list:
///
/// ```rust
/// #[crossmist::main]
/// #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
/// async fn main() {
///     // ...
/// }
/// ```
pub use crossmist_derive::main;

///
/// This derive macro enables the corresponding type to be passed via channels and to and from child
/// processes. [`Object`] can be implemented for a struct/enum if all of its fields implement
/// [`Object`]:
///
/// This is okay:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use crossmist::Object;
/// #[derive(Object)]

/// # use crossmist::Object;
